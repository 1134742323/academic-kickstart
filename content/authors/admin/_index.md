I am now a senior undergrad student of sofeware engineering at BUPT, China and a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia. Prior to that, I once interned and studied in UT Austin, Tsinghua and SenseTime Research.

My research interests include **machine learning** particularly **deep neural network**, **computer vision** and **graph neural network**.  Specifically, I am interested in developing efficient, robust and provable algorithms for machine learning problems and apply them in applications like graph mining and autonomous driving.

**I'm currently looking for PhD positions starting fall 2020.**
