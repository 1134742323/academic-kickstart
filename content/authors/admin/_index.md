I am now a final year undergrad of sofeware engineering at BUPT, China and a research intern at MSRA. I once interned and studied at UT Austin, Tsinghua and SenseTime Research.

<!-- My research interests include **machine learning** particularly **deep neural network**, **computer vision** and **graph neural network**.  Specifically, I am interested in developing efficient, robust and provable algorithms for machine learning problems and apply them in applications like graph mining and autonomous driving. -->

**I will join MMLab@NTU as Ph.D studnet since July, 2020**
